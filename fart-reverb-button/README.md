# Fart Reverb Button
This package adds a global shortcut (`CTRL/CMD+ALT+F`) to *any* Electron app you choose to use it on, and it will play a fart sound with reverb.

This is a meme package, however can serve the purpose of being an example of how to register global shortcuts for the Electron app and use Kernel's `broadcast` module to send and receive events to Electron's different contexts.
